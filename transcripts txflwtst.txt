Julia: Hi Alex, thank you for booking the call. Why don’t we start with a quick overview of what Finwise Labs does and what led you to reach out? 
Alex: Sure. We're a fintech startup based in New York. We’re building a B2B payments API for international transactions. We raised our seed round recently, and now we're working with enterprise clients, so we need stronger legal coverage—especially around contracts and structuring. 
Julia: Congratulations on the funding. So, are you currently incorporated in the U.S.? If so, what’s the structure?
Alex: Yes, we have a Delaware C-Corp and a holding entity in the Cayman Islands that owns it 100%. We also have a Brazilian subsidiary since we’re expanding there.
Julia: Understood. Are you already working with legal counsel?
Alex: We had a solo attorney helping us early on, but now that we're doing larger contracts and have a more complex structure, we need a law firm with experience in venture-backed companies.
Julia: What kind of support are you looking for? Ongoing general counsel? Contract review? Anything else?
Alex: Yes, mainly ongoing legal support—reviewing and redrafting MSAs, NDAs, employment agreements. We’re also considering restructuring the board and possibly issuing equity to advisors.
Julia: Got it. Do you have any upcoming deadlines or urgent matters?
Alex: We have two contracts under negotiation now—one with a U.S. client and one in Brazil. We’d need support reviewing those next week.
Julia: Makes sense. Final question—how many people are on your team now, and do you have an internal legal person?
Alex: We’re 12 full-time employees, and no internal counsel yet. That’s why we’re looking for an outside firm we can rely on.
Julia: Perfect. Based on what you’ve shared, you’re definitely a good fit for our startup practice. I’ll go ahead and prepare a proposal outlining our scope of work and include a short intake checklist so we can get started.
Alex: Sounds great. Looking forward to it.

Julia: Hi Lauren, thanks for booking time with me. To get us started, could you tell me a bit about your business and why you reached out?
Lauren: Sure. I run a wellness coaching business here in Colorado. It’s just me for now—I offer 1:1 coaching and group workshops, both online and in-person. I’ve been running it for about three years and things are going well.
Julia: Great to hear. What sort of legal support are you currently looking for?
Lauren: Well, I’m looking to trademark my business name and maybe get help writing terms and conditions for my website and waivers for my coaching clients. I want to make sure I’m protected.
Julia: Understood. Are you incorporated already?
Lauren: I’m a sole proprietor right now, but I’ve been thinking about forming an LLC.
Julia: Okay. Just so I’m transparent up front, our firm primarily works with venture-backed startups and small to mid-sized companies. We don’t typically handle trademarks or consumer-facing terms for solo service providers, though I can recommend a few colleagues who do that work.
Lauren: Oh, okay. That makes sense. I saw your firm on a startup resource list and thought you might be a fit.
Julia: No worries at all. Just to confirm—are you planning to raise outside investment or expand to a corporate structure in the near future?
Lauren: Probably not. I want to stay solo and keep it simple for now.
Julia: Got it. Then I think a boutique solo practitioner might be the right fit for your needs. I’m happy to introduce you to someone who focuses on this kind of work.
Lauren: That would be great. Thanks for the honesty.
Julia: Of course. I’ll send over a few names after this call.

Claudia: Hi Emilio, thanks for scheduling our discovery call. Could you start by telling me what NovaGuard Technologies does and what prompted you to reach out?
Emilio: Absolutely. We're a cybersecurity startup based in San Francisco. We recently closed our Series A round, and we're developing a cloud-native security platform that integrates with AWS and Azure. Our enterprise pipeline is growing, and we need robust legal support for partnership agreements, data privacy compliance, and IP protection.
Claudia: Congratulations on the Series A! Can you share your current corporate structure?
Emilio: Sure. We’re incorporated as a Delaware C-Corp, with a UK subsidiary for our EMEA operations.
Claudia: Are you currently working with any legal counsel?
Emilio: We worked with a solo consultant early on, but now that our contracts are more complex, we need a full-service firm experienced in venture-backed companies.
Claudia: Understood. What specific services are you looking for—ongoing general counsel, contract drafting, compliance audits?
Emilio: Yes, we need ongoing general counsel, drafting and reviewing master services agreements, privacy policies, and assistance with SOC 2 compliance.
Claudia: Do you have any critical deadlines coming up?
Emilio: We're aiming to finalize a vendor partnership agreement next week, and start our SOC 2 audit in two months.
Claudia: Great. How large is your team, and do you have in-house legal?
Emilio: We have 25 employees and no in-house counsel yet.
Claudia: Based on what you've shared, NovaGuard is a great fit for our venture practice. I'll prepare a proposal outlining our scope and deliver an intake checklist by end of day.
Emilio: That sounds perfect, Claudia. Thank you.

Claudia: Hi Valeria, thank you for joining today. Could you tell me about your business and what kind of legal help you need?
Valeria: Sure. I run SweetSpot Bakery, a small artisanal bakery in Boulder, Colorado. It's a sole proprietorship; I handle everything from baking to customer orders. I'm looking to draft an employee handbook, update my lease agreement, and create liability waivers for baking classes I teach.
Claudia: That sounds interesting. Are you incorporated?
Valeria: No, it's just me as a sole proprietor right now.
Claudia: I want to be transparent: our firm specializes in representing venture-backed tech and growth-stage companies. We typically don't handle small business compliance or personal liability waivers.
Valeria: I see. I came across your firm through a local business directory and thought you might be able to help.
Claudia: I appreciate that. Are you planning to seek outside investment or expand into a corporate structure soon?
Valeria: Not at the moment. I'm happy keeping it small and independent.
Claudia: Understood. I think a boutique firm specializing in small business or a solo practitioner would be the best fit for your needs. I'd be happy to refer you to a trusted local attorney who handles hospitality and food service legal matters.
Valeria: That would be very helpful. Thank you, Claudia.
Claudia: Of course. I'll send you their contact information shortly.
Valeria: Thank you so much.
