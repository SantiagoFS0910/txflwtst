### 2)
**Background**
 Lauren runs a wellness coaching business in Colorado, offering 1:1 coaching and group workshops, both online and in-person. She has been running the business as a sole proprietor for three years.

**Challenges**

 Not Qualified

**Justification**
 The firm primarily works with venture-backed startups and small to mid-sized companies, and does not typically handle trademarks or consumer-facing terms for solo service providers like this client.

 Valeria runs SweetSpot Bakery, a small artisanal bakery in Boulder, Colorado, operating as a sole proprietorship.

**Needs**
 Valeria needs an employee handbook drafted, her lease agreement updated, and liability waivers created for baking classes she teaches.

**Challenges**
 Valeria's primary challenge is finding legal assistance suitable for a small business, as the firm she contacted specializes in larger, venture-backed tech companies.

**Overall Decision**
 Not Qualified

**Justification**
 The client's needs (employee handbook, lease agreement update, liability waivers) are outside the firm's specialization in venture-backed tech and growth-stage companies.
