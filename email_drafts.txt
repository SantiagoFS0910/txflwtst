Subject:Proposal for Legal Services - Finwise Labs
Dear Alex,

It was a pleasure speaking with you about the exciting work happening at Finwise Labs. We understand you're building a cutting-edge B2B payments API for international transactions, and we're impressed with your recent seed round and expansion into enterprise clients and international markets, specifically Brazil.

At [Your Law Firm Name], we specialize in providing comprehensive legal support to venture-backed fintech startups like Finwise Labs. We have extensive experience working with Delaware C-Corps, holding entities in Cayman Islands, and international subsidiaries, as well as advising on issues related to B2B SaaS, international payments, and regulatory compliance.

We understand you’re looking for a reliable outside counsel with more experience handling venture-backed companies and larger contracts than you've had in the past. Our team offers a proactive and practical approach, focusing on providing clear and actionable advice tailored to your specific needs.

Given your immediate need for contract review – particularly the US and Brazilian contracts you mentioned needing assistance with next week – and your ongoing requirements for MSA, NDA, and employment agreement support, we believe a **retainer engagement** would be the most effective way for us to partner with Finwise Labs. This will ensure you have consistent access to our expertise and resources when you need them most. This also allows us to be proactive and learn the ins and outs of your business to provide the best counsel.

Beyond contract support, we can also assist with your board restructuring and equity issuance plans. Our experience in these areas will help ensure a smooth and compliant process.

To help us understand your needs more fully and prepare to review your contracts next week, we've included a brief questionnaire below. Your answers will allow us to hit the ground running.

**Contract Drafting and Review Checklist:**

*   Draft or prior version of the contract (if reviewing)
*   List of parties involved, including legal names and roles
*   Business context and objectives of the agreement
*   Key terms or clauses the client wants to include
*   Timeline for completion or negotiation
*   Any prior negotiation history or redlines (if applicable)

We're confident that [Your Law Firm Name] can provide the dedicated legal support Finwise Labs needs to navigate its next stage of growth. We're excited about the opportunity to learn more about your business and discuss how we can help you achieve your goals.

We’d be happy to schedule a call to discuss our proposal in more detail and answer any questions you may have.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Thank you for considering [Law Firm Name] to assist with your legal needs. We appreciate you reaching out to us.

After reviewing your requirements, we've determined that we are unfortunately not the best fit for your current needs. Our firm primarily focuses on serving venture-backed startups and mid-sized companies, and your request for trademarking assistance and drafting consumer-facing terms for a solo wellness coaching business falls outside our core practice areas.

We understand the importance of finding the right legal support and recommend seeking out firms specializing in small business and intellectual property matters. We wish you the best in finding suitable counsel.

Subject: Proposal for Ongoing Legal Support - NovaGuard Technologies
Dear Emilio,

Following our discussion, I'm pleased to present a proposal for [Your Law Firm Name/Your Name if Solo Practitioner] to provide ongoing legal support to NovaGuard Technologies. We understand NovaGuard's needs have expanded rapidly since closing your Series A and are excited about the potential of your cloud-native security platform.

Given NovaGuard's sophisticated legal requirements and immediate needs – including finalizing a critical vendor partnership agreement next week and preparing for a SOC 2 audit within two months – we believe a **retainer engagement** is the most effective way to provide proactive and responsive legal services. This will allow us to dedicate the necessary resources and expertise to support NovaGuard’s growth and protect your valuable intellectual property.

We recognize NovaGuard’s immediate priorities include:

*   **Contract Drafting and Review:** Specifically, the urgent vendor partnership agreement requiring immediate finalization.
*   **Data Privacy Compliance:** Assisting with drafting and reviewing privacy policies to ensure compliance with evolving regulations.
*   **SOC 2 Compliance:** Guiding NovaGuard through the audit process and ensuring necessary legal documentation is in place.
*   **IP Protection:** Safeguarding NovaGuard's core technology and brand.
*   **General Counsel Services:** Providing ongoing guidance on a wide range of legal matters as they arise.

Our team has extensive experience working with cybersecurity startups, particularly those operating within the AWS and Azure ecosystems. We are well-versed in Delaware C-Corp law, UK subsidiary operations, and the specific legal challenges faced by companies with a distributed workforce.

To ensure we can hit the ground running and address your immediate needs effectively, please find below a brief questionnaire relating to **Contract Drafting and Review** for the vendor partnership agreement:

**Contract Drafting and Review Questionnaire**

*   **Draft or prior version of the contract:** Please provide the latest draft of the vendor partnership agreement.
*   **List of parties involved, including legal names and roles:** Please provide the full legal names and roles of all parties involved in the agreement.
*   **Business context and objectives of the agreement:** Please provide a brief overview of the purpose and intended outcomes of this partnership.
*   **Key terms or clauses the client wants to include:** Please highlight any specific terms or clauses that are particularly important to NovaGuard.
*   **Timeline for completion or negotiation:** You mentioned needing this finalized next week. What is the specific deadline you are working towards?
*   **Any prior negotiation history or redlines (if applicable):** Please provide any history of negotiations or redlines exchanged with the vendor.

We will also need to schedule a brief call to discuss the specifics of your SOC 2 audit preparation and data privacy compliance needs. We’ll send a separate questionnaire tailored to those areas after our initial call.

We are confident that our expertise and dedicated approach will provide NovaGuard Technologies with the robust legal support it needs to navigate the complexities of a rapidly growing cybersecurity startup.

We look forward to discussing this proposal further. Please feel free to schedule a call at your convenience using this link: [Insert Scheduling Link Here]

Dear Valeria,

Thank you for considering [Firm Name] for your legal needs. We appreciate you taking the time to reach out and discuss your requirements for SweetSpot Bakery.

After careful consideration, we have determined that your current needs fall outside our firm's primary area of specialization. Our expertise is largely focused on serving venture-backed technology and growth-stage companies, and we believe your requirements for an employee handbook, lease agreement update, and liability waivers would be best served by a firm with specific experience in small business and general business law.

We wish you the best in finding suitable legal counsel and success with SweetSpot Bakery.
